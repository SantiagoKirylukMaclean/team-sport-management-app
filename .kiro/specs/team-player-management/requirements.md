# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive player management system for teams within the sports management application. The system allows coaches and administrators to manage players within their assigned teams, while super administrators have full access to all players across all teams. The implementation includes database schema with Row Level Security (RLS), frontend interfaces for CRUD operations, and proper role-based access control integration with the existing authentication system.

## Glossary

- **Player_Management_System**: The complete system for managing player records within teams
- **Team_Player**: An individual player record associated with a specific team
- **Jersey_Number**: A unique numerical identifier for a player within their team
- **RLS_Policy**: Row Level Security policy that controls database access based on user roles
- **Coach_Interface**: The user interface accessible to coaches for managing their team's players
- **Admin_Interface**: The user interface accessible to administrators for managing players across teams

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a super administrator, I want to access and manage all players across all teams, so that I can maintain complete oversight of player data throughout the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with role 'super_admin' accesses the player management interface, THE Player_Management_System SHALL display all players from all teams
2. WHEN a super administrator creates a new Team_Player, THE Player_Management_System SHALL allow assignment to any team in the system
3. WHEN a super administrator updates a Team_Player, THE Player_Management_System SHALL allow modification of all player fields including team assignment
4. WHEN a super administrator deletes a Team_Player, THE Player_Management_System SHALL remove the player record from the database
5. THE Player_Management_System SHALL enforce these permissions through database RLS_Policy for super administrators

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a coach or administrator, I want to manage players only within my assigned teams, so that I can maintain my team roster while respecting organizational boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with role 'coach' or 'admin' accesses the player management interface, THE Player_Management_System SHALL display only players from teams they are authorized to manage
2. WHEN a coach creates a new Team_Player, THE Player_Management_System SHALL only allow assignment to teams they are authorized to manage
3. WHEN a coach updates a Team_Player, THE Player_Management_System SHALL only allow modification of players from their authorized teams
4. WHEN a coach attempts to delete a Team_Player, THE Player_Management_System SHALL only allow deletion of players from their authorized teams
5. THE Player_Management_System SHALL enforce these permissions through database RLS_Policy using team authorization checks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a team manager, I want to assign unique jersey numbers to players within each team, so that players can be properly identified during games and team activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new Team_Player with a Jersey_Number, THE Player_Management_System SHALL ensure the number is unique within that specific team
2. WHEN updating a Team_Player's Jersey_Number, THE Player_Management_System SHALL validate uniqueness within the team before saving
3. IF a duplicate Jersey_Number is attempted within a team, THEN THE Player_Management_System SHALL display an error message "That jersey number already exists in this team"
4. WHEN a Team_Player is created without a Jersey_Number, THE Player_Management_System SHALL allow the record to be saved with a null jersey number
5. THE Player_Management_System SHALL enforce jersey number uniqueness through database constraints

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of the player management system, I want clear feedback and error handling during all operations, so that I understand the system state and can resolve any issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a database operation fails due to insufficient permissions, THE Player_Management_System SHALL display the message "You don't have permission to access players for this team"
2. WHEN a Jersey_Number constraint violation occurs, THE Player_Management_System SHALL display a user-friendly error message about the duplicate number
3. WHEN any player operation is in progress, THE Player_Management_System SHALL display appropriate loading indicators
4. WHEN player data is successfully created, updated, or deleted, THE Player_Management_System SHALL display confirmation messages using the existing toast system
5. IF no players exist for a team, THEN THE Player_Management_System SHALL display an empty state message encouraging the user to add the first player

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the player management system to integrate seamlessly with existing application architecture, so that it maintains consistency and leverages established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Player_Management_System SHALL use the existing Supabase client configuration and error handling patterns
2. THE Player_Management_System SHALL implement TypeScript interfaces that extend existing database type definitions
3. THE Player_Management_System SHALL use existing UI components and design system patterns for consistency
4. THE Player_Management_System SHALL integrate with the existing authentication and role management system
5. THE Player_Management_System SHALL follow established routing patterns and navigation structure

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the player database schema to be properly structured with appropriate indexes and constraints, so that the system performs efficiently and maintains data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Player_Management_System SHALL create a 'players' table with proper foreign key relationships to the teams table
2. THE Player_Management_System SHALL include an index on team_id for efficient querying of players by team
3. THE Player_Management_System SHALL implement a unique constraint on the combination of team_id and jersey_number
4. THE Player_Management_System SHALL enable Row Level Security on the players table
5. THE Player_Management_System SHALL create the database schema through an idempotent migration that can be safely re-run

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a coach accessing the player management interface, I want to efficiently view and manage my team's roster, so that I can quickly make necessary updates and maintain accurate player information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the player list for a team, THE Coach_Interface SHALL display players ordered by jersey number in ascending order
2. WHEN creating or editing a Team_Player, THE Coach_Interface SHALL provide form validation for required fields
3. WHEN deleting a Team_Player, THE Coach_Interface SHALL require confirmation before proceeding with the deletion
4. THE Coach_Interface SHALL prevent double-submission of forms during create and update operations
5. THE Coach_Interface SHALL provide clear navigation between team selection and player management views
