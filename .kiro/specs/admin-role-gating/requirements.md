# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements role-based access control (RBAC) for the sports management application, specifically focusing on admin functionality gating. The system will restrict access to administrative features based on user roles stored in the database, ensuring that only super administrators can access sensitive management functions for sports, clubs, and teams. The implementation includes session management, route protection, and a dedicated admin interface with proper navigation controls.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a super administrator, I want to access administrative functions for managing sports, clubs, and teams, so that I can maintain the core data structures of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with role 'super_admin' logs in THEN the system SHALL display an Admin menu option in the navigation
2. WHEN a super admin clicks on the Admin menu THEN the system SHALL navigate to the admin dashboard with sub-navigation for Sports, Clubs, and Teams
3. WHEN a super admin navigates to /admin/sports THEN the system SHALL display a list of all sports with id, name, and created_at fields
4. WHEN a super admin navigates to /admin/clubs THEN the system SHALL display a list of all clubs with their associated sport names
5. WHEN a super admin navigates to /admin/teams THEN the system SHALL display a list of all teams with their associated club names
6. WHEN displaying admin lists THEN the system SHALL limit results to 25 items per page and order by created_at descending

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a non-super administrator user (admin, coach, player), I want the system to prevent me from accessing administrative functions, so that sensitive data remains secure and the interface stays clean.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with role other than 'super_admin' logs in THEN the system SHALL NOT display the Admin menu option
2. WHEN a non-super admin user manually navigates to any /admin/* route THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the home page
3. WHEN a user's role is being determined THEN the system SHALL show a loading state and prevent access to protected routes
4. IF a user has no role assigned THEN the system SHALL treat them as non-super admin and deny admin access

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want user sessions to be properly managed with role information, so that role-based access control works reliably across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL fetch their role from the profiles table and store it in session state
2. WHEN the authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update the session context with current user and role information
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all session data including user and role information
4. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL check for existing authentication and load the user's role
5. IF there is an error fetching user role THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully and default to no admin access

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript types and error handling for the role system, so that the code is maintainable and robust.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining user roles THEN the system SHALL use a strict TypeScript union type: 'super_admin' | 'admin' | 'coach' | 'player'
2. WHEN fetching data from Supabase THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and display appropriate error messages
3. WHEN database queries fail THEN the system SHALL show user-friendly error messages and not crash the application
4. WHEN loading states occur THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading indicators
5. IF foreign key relationships cannot be fetched via joins THEN the system SHALL fall back to separate queries and manual mapping

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the admin interface to be intuitive and consistent with the existing application design, so that I can efficiently navigate and use the administrative functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the admin layout THEN the system SHALL provide a sidebar navigation with clear links to Sports, Clubs, and Teams
2. WHEN navigating between admin sections THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent layout and styling
3. WHEN viewing admin lists THEN the system SHALL use existing UI components and follow the application's design system
4. WHEN admin data is loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states using existing components
5. WHEN there are no items to display THEN the system SHALL show a user-friendly empty state message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious stakeholder, I want route protection to be enforced at multiple levels, so that unauthorized access is prevented even if users attempt to bypass the UI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing route guards THEN the system SHALL check user role before rendering protected components
2. WHEN a route guard detects unauthorized access THEN the system SHALL redirect to a safe location immediately
3. WHEN the session is loading THEN the system SHALL prevent rendering of protected content until role is determined
4. WHEN implementing admin routes THEN the system SHALL wrap all admin pages with appropriate guards
5. IF a user's session expires while on admin pages THEN the system SHALL redirect them to login and clear admin access
