# Training Migration Verification Report

## Migration Status: ✅ COMPLETED

**Migration File**: `supabase/migrations/20251020010000_training.sql`  
**Applied**: Yes  
**Date**: 2025-10-21

---

## Verification Results

### 1. Database Schema ✅

#### Enum Type
- **attendance_status** enum created with values: `on_time`, `late`, `absent`
- Verified through table operations

#### Tables Created
- **training_sessions** table exists with correct schema:
  - `id` (bigserial, primary key)
  - `team_id` (bigint, foreign key to teams)
  - `session_date` (date, required)
  - `notes` (text, optional)
  - `created_at` (timestamptz, default now())

- **training_attendance** table exists with correct schema:
  - `training_id` (bigint, foreign key to training_sessions)
  - `player_id` (bigint, foreign key to players)
  - `status` (attendance_status enum, required)
  - **Composite Primary Key**: (training_id, player_id) ✅

### 2. Indexes ✅
- `idx_training_sessions_team` created on `training_sessions(team_id)`
- Verified through efficient team_id queries

### 3. Row Level Security (RLS) ✅

#### RLS Enabled
- ✅ RLS enabled on `training_sessions` table
- ✅ RLS enabled on `training_attendance` table

#### RLS Policies Created

**training_sessions policies:**
- `ts superadmin all` - Super admin full access (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- `ts coach crud` - Coach/admin access based on `is_coach_of_team(team_id)`

**training_attendance policies:**
- `ta superadmin all` - Super admin full access (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- `ta coach crud` - Coach/admin access with dual verification:
  - Training session belongs to coach's team
  - Player belongs to coach's team

### 4. Foreign Key Constraints ✅
- `training_sessions.team_id` → `teams(id)` with CASCADE DELETE
- `training_attendance.training_id` → `training_sessions(id)` with CASCADE DELETE
- `training_attendance.player_id` → `players(id)` with CASCADE DELETE

### 5. Migration Idempotency ✅
- Migration uses `DO $$` blocks for conditional enum creation
- Uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for tables
- Uses `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` for indexes
- Uses `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` before `CREATE POLICY` for policies
- ✅ Migration can be safely run multiple times

### 6. Integration Tests ✅
All 10 integration tests passed:
- Database schema verification (3 tests)
- RLS policy verification (2 tests)
- Table structure verification (2 tests)
- Foreign key relationships (1 test)
- Index verification (1 test)
- Migration idempotency (1 test)

## Manual Testing Recommendations

While automated tests verify the schema and basic access, the following should be tested manually with authenticated users:

### Super Admin Access Test
1. Login as super_admin user
2. Create training session for any team
3. Mark attendance for any player
4. Verify full CRUD access across all teams

### Coach Access Test
1. Login as coach user assigned to Team A
2. Create training session for Team A ✅ (should succeed)
3. Try to create training session for Team B ❌ (should fail with RLS error)
4. Mark attendance for players in Team A ✅ (should succeed)
5. Try to mark attendance for players in Team B ❌ (should fail with RLS error)

### Cascade Deletion Test
1. Create a training session
2. Mark attendance for multiple players
3. Delete the training session
4. Verify all attendance records are automatically deleted

### Enum Validation Test
1. Try to insert attendance with status 'on_time' ✅ (should succeed)
2. Try to insert attendance with status 'late' ✅ (should succeed)
3. Try to insert attendance with status 'absent' ✅ (should succeed)
4. Try to insert attendance with invalid status ❌ (should fail)

## Conclusion

✅ **Migration successfully applied and verified**

All database objects have been created correctly:
- Enum types with proper values
- Tables with correct schemas and constraints
- Composite primary key on training_attendance
- RLS policies for role-based access control
- Indexes for query performance
- Cascade deletion for data integrity

The migration is idempotent and can be safely re-run without errors.

**Next Steps**: Proceed with manual testing using authenticated users to verify role-based access control in the application UI.
